                The spontaneity and searching spirit that defined my college experience prompted me to constantly explore new ideas. I worry about losing the fire of this passionate curiosity. I hope this page, through which I seek to record the new discoveries, studies, and experiences I encounter, will give me more reasons to continue learning and exploring.

                    <p>The notion of risk is at the basis of financial mathematics. Whether attempting to derive the value of a bond several time periods from now or the premium for a certain insurance plan, these calculations rely on an understanding of the various possible states of the world and a way to codify them mathematically. The language of probability is vital in this task.</p>
                    <p>Towards the end of my undergraduate studies, Professor Peter Jones, with whom I was taking my mathematics capstone seminar, encouraged me to study the Black-Scholes-Merton model, one of the most important equations in financial mathematics (for which Scholes and Merton received the <span href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/1997/press-release/">Nobel Prize in Economics in 1997</span>). The problem of properly valuing options and other derivatives had stumped mathematicians and economists for many decades. When Black and Scholes turned their attention to the task, the valuation was undertaken by discounting the future expected value of the stock. In doing so, assumptions had to be made about the risk premium to be used in the discounting process. Black and Scholes, however, found that such assumptions were unnecessary since the risk premia were embedded in the stock prices.</p>

                    <p>The format of the classical concert experience has remained static for many years. Even the range of music performed in concert halls has been little changed; we listen to the same Bach, Beethoven, and Brahms that our parents and grandparents may have listened to. Admittedly there are many new music groups and composers who are working to expand the genre. But I must admit it is falling in this regard when compared to other artforms (see musical theatre, popular music, film, visual arts).</p>
                    <p>As a conductor and violinist, presenting this artform that I love so dearly in non-traditional ways has been a driving passion behind my work. (That is not to say there is no room for the traditional concert experience. Merely, there may be as of yet untried ideas of how to present classical music.) 2x2, read as "typeset two x two," was my first large-scale attempt at this. The goal was simple: drawing inspiration from religious rituals and ceremonies, I hoped to combine music, audience participation, and spoken word to present a unique artistic experience for all those involved. The notion of dualities was key to the project, which employed two conductors, two ensembles (one instrumental, one vocal), and two performers, the instrumentalists and the audience members, themselves.</p>
