            <h3>My mind's constant explorations</h3>
            
            <p>I’d like to consider myself an active individual. What do I mean by that? Well, I am certainly no athelete; I loathe going to the gym (I dislike suffering the pains of overused muscles the following days). What I mean to say is that I often find myself juggling multiple activities at once. My mind is restless. I drafted this essay while studying for the GREs. I have a dozen other essay, film, and concert ideas drafted on my notes app that are half-formed, nascent, and—one might say—abandoned. I live in this world of ideas, fantasizing and planning but seldom doing. (That’s why this website is here—so I can actually turn my ideas into action!)</p>

            <p>Post-graduation, my goal has been to remain busy as I was during my undergraduate days. It is easy, when in school, to become complacent, especially when one is already so busy. And I was, juggling studies, work, and music. There was always something to be done. I didn’t have time to pursue something outside of what I was already doing, even if I wanted to. But now, there is so much time to be wasted if I am not careful. But while I will accept the sin of gluttony, the sin of sloth is… one I find loathsome.</p>

            <p>So at the beginning of the summer, once I graduated, I set out to leave the house as much as possible. I went to the library. I went hiking (or rather, trail running). I explored some new eateries in the area. The freedom of mind and body that comes from such exploration and constant activity is indescribable.</p>

            <p>But I am not here to talk about the healthy habits I’ve developed these past few months. (Although on second thought, that seems to be another possible essay topic for the future.) No, I instead want to discuss my propensity to daydream, to let my overactive mind run through the fields of possibilities, when there are other things in my immediate reality that should occupy my attention. I find myself in concerts thinking of my next performance ideas. I walk through rows of paintings at museums with my favorite Brahms symphonic passages running through my head. I work out a mathematics problem and as I brainstorm essay topics. My mind constantly explores and wanders.</p>

            <p>In some ways, this tendency has been helpful. When I was taking an unreasonable number of courses during several semesters of my undergraduate studies, I found myself subconsciously working out proofs for my mathematics problem sets while doing the readings for my English class. Fairly often, I’d take midday naps where the solution to my academic quandaries would leap at me upon my waking.</p>

            <p>In others, it has been a hindrance. I worry that I never truly concentrate on the now because I am always thinking of other things as well. Perhaps this conundrum drives my interest in ontology, for the nature of beingness of my thoughts compared to my lived, or rather sensed, reality has always been a seeming contradiction in my life.</p>

            <p>Whether a blessing or a curse (a conclusion I doubt will be reached anytime soon), it is an undeniable part of my working habit, and the best I can do is to adapt to it as best as possible. I try my best to keep track of my errant thoughts, document them, and return to them in the future when I am a bit less scatterbrained. Which is exactly what I did with this essay...</p>
