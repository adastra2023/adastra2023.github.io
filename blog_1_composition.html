            <h3>On the nature of compositions - inspired by a discussion</h3>
            <p>On the walk home from the library, where I’d gone to get my first ever college writing assignment reviewed, I was engaged in a rather contentious conversation with a composer and conductor (the same person, in fact, who’d been reading over my work less than an hour prior) on the nature of composition. Considerations on the nature of classics and historical poetry—my writing assignment was to produce a classic à la Herodotus and Virgil, a work of timeless significance and something that could be read a hundred years from now—gave way to intense debate on what qualifies a piece of music as a composition.</p>
            <p>My verbal sparring partner, hailing from a jazz background, suggested that all musical performances, improvisations, and ideas are compositions. In essence, all musical work can be seen as a composition. Etymologically, this assertion makes sense. Compose derives from the Latin roots “com” and “ponere”: to put together. All musical works, performed, written, or envisioned, rely on a careful arrangement of sounds and rhythms. Thus, any form in which this conscious arrangement is undertaken must be a composition.</p>
            <p>I am (and was) hesitant to accept this viewpoint. The musical ideas running through the minds of composers will, if not recorded in some way, inevitably be lost. These ideas have no possibility of being recovered once they are forgotten or once their progenitors are deceased. (Of course, the same idea may be envisioned by another composer. But I would be hesitant to call it a recovery.) Their existence is fragile, at best.</p>
            <p>By now, you may begin to understand the crux of my dissention to the above notion of composition: its reproducibility. For me, the reproducibility of a musical work, whether visually or orally, is one of the defining characteristics of a composition. If no record exists, even within the fallible minds of one or two spectators, then it exists in the world of half-formed ideas and improvisations, not compositions. That is not to say that improvisations are not compositions. If one improvises in the presence of others or records his or her spontaneous creations, with the possibility of an at least passable reproduction, the work would be considered a composition according to the above definition.</p>
            <p>Admittedly, the boundary between a musical idea and a composition can be confusing. A composer’s musical idea always flirts with the possibility of realization and reproducibility. A composer can practice his or her musical idea alone repeatedly in a soundproof studio without recording anything. The idea is reproducible, but would it count as a composition? Thus, it may be desirable to add an addendum to the above definition: a composition has the potential of being realized by those other than the originator.</p>
            <p>I would venture that this definition would be appealing to at least some of the great composers. Brahms, for instance, was notorious for destroying unfinished or unsatisfactory works. The destruction of these compositions was undertaken by destroying the very vehicle by which they could be realized by those other than himself. We can begin to conceptualize a different understanding of the roots of “com” and “ponere” beyond simply the pattern of pitches and rhythms of a musical work. It now acknowledges the interpretive process of “putting together” that occurs each time a composition is performed. It now ties together composer and performer.</p>
            <p>My background as a conductor, and not a composer, may color my view. My role is diametrically opposed to that of the composer. The composer faces a blank sheet of paper and suffuses it with meaning. The conductor sees the completed page and attempts to uncover the underlying intent. Furthermore, I am almost always in the position of the interpreter, not the creator. (I have tried my hand at composition upon the advice of my first conducting teacher, who thought of it as an important exercise in improving one’s interpretation skills. Simply put, it is not where my passions lie.) Thus, my unorthodox definition, which attempts to elucidate the subtle differences between compositions from musical performances, more generally, biases the performer.</p>
            <p>Almost four years later, I remember very little about my first writing assignment (clearly, it was not such a successful attempt at a classic). I don’t recall too much about the ensuing conversation either. The ideas raised that evening, however, were significant enough to consume my thoughts ever so often throughout my college years. We shall see how they persist in the years to come.</p>
