            <h3>Thinking of coding as simply another language</h3>
            
            <p>Several days ago at work, I struck up conversation with a commercial banker who was sitting at a neighboring desk. Our ‘hot desk’ system means that I find myself surrounded by unfamiliar individuals not so irregularly. Being particularly curious about the sales side of banking, I asked some generic questions about their role: how to keep up to date with industry trends, what have firms been most concerned about in a rising rate environment, how to differentiate oneself to potential commercial clients given the competitive landscape of banking and the seeming homogeneity of lending products. They responded with curiosity about my role. In my current rotation in issues management, I replied, I leverage the bank’s data on its retail lending portfolio (anything from mortgages to auto loans) to identify the impacted population and outline the necessary remediative actions arising from problems and systems deficiencies identified by the business.</p>

            <p>“Do you code?” they asked once I gave an example of the types of remediations my team handled. Of all of the details questions they might have asked—what are the common triggers of issues, are there certain products which are prone to issues, are there differences in how the bank treats customer identified issues as opposed to bank identified ones—they focused on my ability to code. Reflecting on my previous encounters with people across the bank, I do not believe this fascination with coding is an isolated incident. Several people have expressed awe at my self-professed ability to code (without even having seen any of my work!). And while I am always happy to be perceived as intelligent, I have also found this assumption to be a gross generalization and exaggeration. On the one hand, I have met many people who code without any understanding of the underlying logic of the functions they employ. (This is a topic for another time.) On the other hand, I believe that coding is no more difficult a skill than acquiring another language. It is this latter point I want to emphasize.</p>

            <p>Before I continue, let me first confess my still-rather rudimentary knowledge of computer science—I took one lecture in college and continue to supplement my understanding with research papers and online resources as necessary. However, I have writing code for several years now and taught applications in programming as a TA for various quantitative reasoning courses in college, many of which included some coding component, and I believe I have some insight of value to share based on my personal experiences.</p>

            <p>Fundamentally—and this is nothing new to students of computer science who read Chomsky in their linguistics courses—I want people, especially from non-coding backgrounds, to consider code as simply another language (or rather languages).</p>

            <p>“A programming language is a system of notation for writing computer programs.” As of when this post was written, this was the first sentence of the Wikipedia entry for Programming Languages. Python, R, C++: these programming languages are in many ways quite similar to English, Korean, or Latin (and yes, before you ask, these are some of the human languages that I am familiar with). Similarly to how we can use English to express our thoughts through a series of lines, squiggles, and dashes (or a sequence of consonants and vowels), code helps us encapsulate logical processes that can then be relayed to and executed by a computer (or other machine). It is like writing a mathematical proof, where each line is carefully reasoned in its most basic steps (couldn't we also conceive of mathematical writing as a language of sorts for a range of structured methods of thinking?).</p>

            <p>Both human and computer languages have grammatical and syntactical structures that shape how we read, write, and comprehend a series of scratches or typeset characters. Code may appear weirder to us at first sight because of the presence of some non-alphanumeric symbols. That being said, for those who use the Roman alphabet, I would argue that learning to code is easier than learning Korean or, heavens forbid, Chinese-memorizing the characters is hard enough without factoring in their phonetic pronunciations and the presence of tones! Moreover, there is a rather regimented structure to coding languages that lends itself to less leeway than human languages. The same idea (or process) may be written numerous ways in both code and English. But while a fellow (human) conversationalist may be able to read between the lines and determine from several broken words such as "number", "New York Penn", "where", that someone is asking for directions to the proper platform to board a train to New York Penn Station, a machine is often less adept at deciphering this intent without more explicit guidance. A missing colon or a comma in place of a full stop (the latter may simply have arisen due to a printing mishap), while grammatically incorrect and bothersome to encounter, will likely not detract significantly from the meaning of a text. One missing colon in a series of if-else statements in Python will most definitely throw an error, even if all other parts of the program have been written perfectly.</p>

            <p>It would be foolish of me to write about comparisons between coding languages and human languages without at least mentioning the power of AI to allow us translate between the two. I confess that I have yet to jump on the Chat-GPT bandwagon. Software engineers have already spoken about the applications of generative AI programs in drafting code scripts for programming tasks. No longer do coders need to be absolutely proficient in different languages. Possessing the rudimentary knowledge to troubleshoot (debug) a script drafted by Chat-GPT (or some other program) based on requirements delineated by the user may be sufficient.</p>

            <p>For at least another couple of months, I expect my passable knowledge of coding to elicit responses of interest from my colleagues less well-versed in this area. And I am happy to be advantaged by its accompanying assumptions. Yet I must be wary of my impending obsolescence if I base my labor value on my ability to code alone.</p>
