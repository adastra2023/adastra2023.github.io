            <h3>Personality is in the little things</h3>
            
            <p>I started commuting to work a couple of days ago. As of the first draft of this essay (yes, I do make some edits before making my writing public), I have only been into the office three times. But I have already developed a particular habit. Well, perhaps developed is not quite an apt term, for this was a pre-formed behavior. I always enjoyed people-watching. Part of the draw of studying at a café or the public library was the anticipation of what new spectacles I would witness. Admittedly, some days are slower than others. The most boring times are when everyone else seems to be diligently going about their own tasks. (On the upside, their dedication inspires me to concentrate on my task.) But wherever people congregate, activity and drama usually follow. And having started a regular commute, my mornings and afternoons give me plenty of opportunity to observe my fellow bus riders.</p>

            <p>There was the man sitting in front of me who, having turned out the air conditioning vents so that they pointed straight at my eyes, proceeded to fall asleep sideways, thus not even experiencing any of the artificial indoor breeze. By the time I got off my stop, I was on the verge of crying due to the sheer irritation of the cold air but unable to do so because my eyes were so dry. It was miserable, and I vowed to never sit behind this person again.</p>

            <p>One regular I see in the mornings brings his motorized skateboard and helmet on board. As I walked from the Port Authority bus terminal to my office, I could have sworn that I spotted him zooming past me several blocks down. It was reminiscent of all the times I had to avoid scooters, bikes, and skateboards walking to and from classes during college.</p>

            <p>Most people are on their phones. I’m too blind without my glasses to see what my neighbors are doing on their devices, but the usual swiping (up and down, not left and right!) indicates either texting or some video sharing platform. The hunched backs and crooked necks of many a bus rider has made me sit up a little straighter and hold up my phone at a healthier angle, even if my arms tire faster and despite my fears of appearing a little weird.</p>

            <p>I wonder how many of these people are truly focused on their tasks, how many are waiting to open up to someone else who shows even the smallest amount of interest. I say this for even the surliest commuter, if prompted with a question (“is this the express bus?”), is more than happy to help this at-times lost commuter.</p>

            <p>Individually, these small behaviors are easy to overlook. But sometimes, these behaviors occur in conjunction with other comparable actions. The resulting contrasts are impossible to ignore. The inconsiderate vent opener is seated across a commuter who makes sure to point his air conditioning vent only at himself. A lonely phone swiper contrasts a father and daughter duo several rows away. My favorite, however, took place outside the bus.</p>

            <p>The bus takes the main road through the commercial district of my town when I’m returning home. I love people watching during this short segment, for there are all sorts of sights in the streets: families, some elderly grandparents, office workers, students. And unlike New York City, where people sometimes seem too busy and perhaps even uncaring, my town feels comfortable and inviting. One afternoon, as the bus made its way up this main road, I spotted some people outside also trekking up the same road. There was a father and daughter at an intersection. The father had something stuck to his shoe and was scraping his left sole to get rid of the undesirable object. Behind was what I presumed was the rest of the family, the mother with a stroller and the son excitedly writing a bicycle with training wheels. But it was the woman following them who stood out, for her leisurely pace was so self-assured that I doubt anyone would succeed in hurrying her from her own determined path. Clutching a large takeout drink which seemed more ice than liquid at that point, she continued trudging up the hill, visibly slower than all the other pedestrians. Although absent of the at times insurmountably isolating wall of a phone or earphones, she seemed entirely lost to the world around her. Close behind her, was another woman with an entirely different demeanor. This woman did not walk; she strode. I cannot recall exactly anymore, but I imagine she clutched a phone in her hand and had a bag slung over her shoulder. As my bus prepared to turn left into a side road, the women arrived at the intersection at the same time. Mind you, this is a busy crossing. There are pedestrians constantly crossing. It is a main road for cars, so finding the opportunity to make a left turn without incurring the blasting horns of irritated drivers is a perilous task. The bus had half turned, effectively blocking the incoming traffic, when the driver spotted the two women and waited for them to cross. The second woman, the energetic one, saw the waiting bus, waved her hand in thanks, and proceeded to power walk the crossing. The first woman, the leisurely one, continued at the same pace, seemingly indifferent to the large, encroaching vehicle. I doubt she was ignoring us. Rather, I believe she was completely in her own world. Her actions did not seem inconsiderate, although I may have been slightly irritated at the time as I wanted to arrive home quickly and have dinner.</p>

            <p>In my daily life, I am usually the second woman, always keeping an eye out on the crowd as I dart my way through. I used to rue the insensitivity of people like the first woman. “Why aren’t they more observant? Why do they lack even the minimal amount of street smarts? They should not hamper other people.” But recently, I’ve come to envy the single-mindedness of people like the first woman. I may be committing an egregious generalization, but these individuals who walk at their own pace and fail to notice an incoming bus are the same ones who will doggedly pursue their own goals without being discouraged by the voice of dissenters. They are people with their own thoughts and personalities. However misguided or odious they may be in certain cases, they will (almost) never be boring.</p>

            <p>These behaviors offer fascinating character studies. Perhaps one day, I’ll be inspired to write longer form, fictional pieces as opposed to remaining in the more comfortable realm of short form essays. If so, I must strive to remember, personality is in the little things, like crossing the street.</p>
