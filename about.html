            <p>
                Australian-born, of Korean heritage, residing in the United States, I wrestle with the multiplicities of my identity.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am a quantitative analyst&ndash;economics and mathematics are my tools. I am an artist&ndash;a conductor and violinist in concert halls and crowded streets. I am a traditionalist, a lover of rituals and customs. I am an innovator, a seeker of new modes of expression for the already-existing.
            </p>

                The turn of the new year has been spent catching up with old friends, trying new recipes (including a foray into sourdough recipes after receiving a mature starter from a friend), committing to my now-established pattern of limiting myself to a "long" and "short" book, and finding the courage to finally sign up for regular martial arts classes.
            </p>

                Below is a brief snapshot of the things that occupy my mind nowadays. Perhaps one of them will inspire writing for the <a font-weight="bold" href="projects.html">Projects</a> tab.
