                Australian-born, of Korean heritage, residing in the United States, I wrestle with the multiplicities of my identity.

                I am a quantitative analyst - economics and mathematics are my tools. I am an artist - a conductor and violinist in concert halls and crowded streets. I am a traditionalist, a lover of rituals and customs. I am an innovator, a seeker of new modes of expression for the already-existing.
            </p>
            <p>
                Recently graduating from Yale University with a degree in Economics and Mathematics, I started work as a quantitative analyst at PNC Financial Services this summer. In the short transition break, I admired the natural beauty of New Jersey by exploring various hiking trails; relished access to a kitchen again after four years of dorm life; returned to the place of my heritage, South Korea, for the first time in over a decade; and attended a conducting masterclass in Bucharest working on music by Mozart, Beethoven, and Mahler.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here are some of my meaningful recent experiences. I hope this list will be ever-changing.
