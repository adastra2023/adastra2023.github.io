                Australian-born, of Korean heritage, residing in the United States, I wrestle with the multiplicities of my identity.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am a quantitative analyst - economics and mathematics are my tools. I am an artist - a conductor and violinist in concert halls and crowded streets. I am a traditionalist, a lover of rituals and customs. I am an innovator, a seeker of new modes of expression for the already-existing.
            </p>
            <p>
                A recent graduate of Yale University with a degree in Economics and Mathematics in May 2023, I begin work as a quantitative analyst at PNC Financial Services in mid-August. In this short lull, I have admired the natural beauty of New Jersey by exploring various hiking trails, relished access to a kitchen again after four years of dorm life, and studied works by Mozart, Beethoven, and Mahler in preparation for a conducting masterclass in Bucharest.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here are some of my meaningful recent experiences. I hope this list will be ever-changing.
