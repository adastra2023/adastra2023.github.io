            <p>
                Australian-born, of Korean heritage, residing in the United States, I wrestle with the multiplicities of my identity.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am a quantitative analyst - economics and mathematics are my tools. I am an artist - a conductor and violinist in concert halls and crowded streets. I am a traditionalist, a lover of rituals and customs. I am an innovator, a seeker of new modes of expression for the already-existing.
            </p>
            <p>
                Recently graduated with a degree in Economics and Mathematics, I currently work as a quantitative analyst in the financial services industry. In my off hours, I have been roaming local cafes in search of a good drink and study spot, reading novellas (and finishing some longer books, too), and trying new baking recipes.
            </p>
            <p>
                Without revealing too much of my identity, here are some of my recent experiences. I hope this list will be ever-evolving.
