                Australian-born, of Korean heritage, residing in the United States, I wrestle with the multiplicities of my identity.

                I am a quantitative analyst - economics and mathematics are my tools. I am an artist - a conductor and violinist in concert halls and crowded streets. I am a traditionalist, a lover of rituals and customs. I am an innovator, a seeker of new modes of expression for the already-existing.
            </p>
            <p>
                Recently graduating from Yale University with a degree in Economics and Mathematics, I currently work as a quantitative analyst at PNC Financial Services. In my off hours, I have been roaming New Jersey's cafes in search of a good drink and study spot, reading novellas (and finishing some longer books, too), and trying new baking recipes.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here are some of my recent experiences. I hope this list will be ever-changing.
