            <h3>The modern-day Romantic</h3>
            
            <p>How does one define the Romantic in contemporary society? They are distinctly misplaced in a world that increasingly values efficiency over lived experiences, profit over value, and the veneer of success over spiritual maturation. The Romantic is not rushed by Time. Their path may seem aimless, but it matters little to them, for the passages to success and failure are both valuable. Their emotional openness may seem laughable or even childish to the modern individual. Anyone who has lived in today’s world should know better than to reveal their weaknesses and wear their hearts on their sleeves. The Romantic would contend, however: why suppress one of the basest and most honest ways in which we interact with the world? The Romantic seems to be but a caricature of a child in adult’s skin, the encapsulation of immaturity, or at least naïveté.</p>

            <p>I disagree.</p>

            <p>“You are a Romantic, with a capital R.” A musician life mentor told me this during one of our conversations. A Romantic in her own right, this mentor is a respected musician and educator in her field. But being a musician, and a classical musician at that, does not qualify one as a Romantic. No. Her Romanticism is rooted in her open heartedness, her willingness to engage critically (and openly) in ideas beyond comprehension to at least come to a better understanding of worldly issues, and her sheer humility which leads her to see how her beliefs may be shaped by her lived experiences and how they may change through her interactions with even those who are younger and less experienced than her.</p>

            <p>For me, this description clicked with my artistic tastes and sentimentality, and I have discreetly worn this label with pride since then. Isn’t that a contradiction, you may ask, being discreetly prideful? Not necessarily. This label, which I am so fond of, is also one that I only really wish to share with those who may seek to understand its sentiments. In fact, there are very few people to whom I would ascribe this term in its entirety (there are some who share Romantic sensibilities or have Romantic tastes, but I would hesitate to call them Romantics).</p>

            <p>This essay (and my renewed thoughts on Romanticism) was inspired by a rather unique individual I met during my travels in Romania. There was a cafe I frequented as it was halfway between my hotel and the music institution where I was participating in a conducting masterclass. One afternoon, with some time to kill, I lit a cigar and ordered a cup of Earl Grey (a pairing I happened upon back in New Haven). I was struggling with the wind as I was sitting outdoors and using matches, but an elderly man came by to offer a small tip for keeping my cigar well lit (“instead of shielding the cigar with your palm, try using your thumb”). Having struck up a small conversation and with a little over half my cup of tea remaining, I asked if he might join me at my table for a bit before I was obliged to leave. The vibrancy and spright energy that was evident in this individual was contagious. At 70 years of age, he seemed to harbor the curious and exploring spirit of someone much younger. It seemed to me that was probably a difficult man to be wed to (he was divorced) or raised by (he did not seem particularly close to his children). His commitment to freedom and individuality was apparent. But he was a wonderful conversational partner at the cafe on an otherwise rather ordinary afternoon. As our conversation came to an end, I expressed my view that he seemed to be a Romantic. I realize now why I felt so: he was an individual filled with an absolute love for life and the experiences it can offer to those who choose to explore it freely on their own terms. I imagine he also saw the Romantic in me, for before I stood up, he told me: “I love you. Not in that sense, not romantically, but from one human being to another.” We shook hands and parted ways, with that conversation a single memento of what would likely be our first and last encounter.</p>

            <p>So, let me return to the question at hand: what is a Romantic? An exact definition, as in almost all scenarios where labels for people are concerned, is impossible for me to describe. Perhaps this concept of the Romantic is all made up, a catch-all term I use to describe people who inspire me in some way. (I doubt this is the case because there are many individuals I admire, but whom I would never describe as Romantics.) Maybe, more likely, I use the label for people who are open and harbor an immense love for life and humanity. But aren’t these qualities all too rare in today’s society? Aren’t they the relics of a young Werther’s age? Although seemingly outdated, I argue that there is an important place for Romantics in the modern world. For the qualities that define Romantics also give rise to another characteristic, one that we could all learn from: optimism. For all the tragedy and angst perpetuated in Romantic art, there is also beauty and light. In the midst of the chaos and ever-increasing pace of change in society, perhaps the Romantic can remind us to see beauty and maintain at least a shred of hope.</p>
