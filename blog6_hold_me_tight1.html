            <h3>Hold Me Tight (2021): An Elegiac Sequence in A Minor, Part I</h3>
            
            <p>Note: This post was first drafted in November, 2023. It has taken me many months to muster the will to finish writing it (or at least the first part, in a presentable form) and post it.</p>

            <p>There are some works of art&ndash;be it literature, film, music&ndash;that I want to keep to myself. Even if I let the titles of these works spill from my lips, I zealously safeguard the profundity of thoughts and feelings they have incited within me. I may offer some general statements, not too dissimilar from already existent reviews flooding the Internet. Constantly, I wrestle with the dichotomous urges to share my thoughts, to make myself understood to someone, and to maintain my secret, to maintain the solitary journey of artistic interpretation.</p>

            <p>I cannot say exactly what prompts such egotism in my relationship with art. Perhaps my actions can be compared to the elementary school student who hides the identity&ndash;nay, even the existence&ndash;of her imaginary friend for fear of being misunderstood. Perhaps it stems from my conviction that true artistic comprehension stems from the self and should not be unduly influenced by others. Perhaps, I am simply a bit of an intellectual snob.</p>

            <p>Over time, I developed two distinct sets of artistic tastes and opinions about art: a more banal preference to be shared widely and a personal viewpoint that is seldom revealed.</p>

            <p>Why do I reveal this secret duality?</p>

            <p>Towards the end of last year, I decided to try my hand at a new form of writing: a film review. Now, I make no pretense of being a film connoisseur. The extent of my knowledge stems from a single seminar taken during my final semester in college and some intermittent supplementary studies to satiate my curiosities on the subject. I methodologically set out to choose a film for the express purpose of writing this essay, scouring (spoiler free) reviews on Roger Ebert. Unfortunately&ndash;or perhaps, rather fortunately&ndash;the film I ended up choosing fell into the category of works described above. I considered choosing a different film; no one would know of my deceit. Alas, my moral code prevents me from capitulating to these selfish inclinations. Reassured by a thing veil of anonymity and low expectations for the number of people trafficking my humble site, I shall proceed with my original plan.</p>

            <p>More experienced critics have struggled to encapsulate the plot of <i>Hold Me Tight (2021)</i> without revealing its central twist. (That being said, I do not think that its reveal would lessen one's enjoyment of the film.) In line with the general approach of other reviews, let me start by describing its premise. The film opens with Vicky Krieps' Clarisse walking out of her home one early morning. As she journeys alone through various locations&ndash;a fish market, a bar full of musicians, a music conservatory, a ski resort&ndash;the film cuts to scenes of the rest of her family back home: a husband, daughter, and son. Once the beginning plot is explained, critics often note how audiences are led to wonder about the circumstances that lead Clarisse to leave her home and her increasingly vulnerable psychological state. Commendations of Krieps' acting abound, with further discussions of the cinematography and direction. While these discussions adequately acquaint the reader to important aspects of the film, most only briefly linger on what I feel to be a central point of the film: the exploration of Clarisse's relationship with her daughter, Lucie, a classical pianist.</p>

            <p>Here, let me make a brief digression and make one clarification&ndash;I expressly attempted to avoid a film about classical music. Given my background, that would defeat the purpose of this endeavor. Yet it turns out that the drama and character psychology of <i>Hold Me Tight (2021)</i> is intrinsically tied to its classical soundtrack. Where many critics glossed over the music in favor of exploring traditional filmmaking aspects, I would argue that the entire film can be understood through the progression of its musical choices. Unfortunately, a comprehensive outline of the soundtrack does not yet exist on the Internet. Thus, in a spell of inspiration, over the course of one sleepless weekend, I identified all the classical pieces in the soundtrack. How, you may ask? Repeat listening, knowledge of compositional styles, Musopedia, and some guidance by film reviews on a subset of composers heard throughout the film.</p>

            <p>The classical soundtrack of <i>Hold Me Tight (2021)</i> can be encapsulated in one simple description: an elegiac sequence in A minor. Admittedly, this may seem similar to the title of the New York Times' review&ndash;'Hold Me Tight' Review: An Étude in the Key of Grief. I will argue, however, that my title is more fitting. The elegiac nature of the music needs no further explanation. The sense of loss is palpable in all aspects of the film. While the nature of Clarisse's separation from her family is nebulous, her isolation is starkly painted in multiple scenes that contrast the physical distance between Clarisse and her family with their sonic connection. As for the key of A Minor, which dominates most of the soundtrack, I can only conjecture as to its function based on the choice (and more importantly, progression) of pieces. In very few films do I recall such a strong emphasis on one key signature. What could be the significance of A Minor? Allow me for a second to fulfill my inner musicological curiosity and pose an abstract hypothesis, removed at the moment from the film's content. In the tradition of classical music, key signatures were often associated with specific moods. According to Christian Friedrich Daniel Schubart's Characterization of Key Signatures in his text, <i>Ideen zu einer Aesthetik der Tonkunst</i> (<i>Ideas on the Aesthetics of the Art of Tone</i>), A Minor was thought to represent <a href = 'https://www.musikipedia.dk/dokumenter/boeger/engelsk-tonkunst.pdf'>"pious womanhood and tenderness of character."</a> It is "simple" (containing no sharps or flats) yet reflective, with a certain element of restraint. Thus, while the New York Times review spoke of a "Key of Grief", I argue that the importance of the soundscape of the film lies in how its juxtaposes the mood of grief with a more muted tone. In the choice of soundtrack, I argue that the film diverts focus from grief, explicitly, to how Clarisse hides her grief.</p>

            <br>

            <p>The tone of A Minor is established at the beginning of the film with the Prélude from Rameau's <i>Premier livre de pièces de clavecin</i> playing over the opening sequence. This quasi-aleatoric movement begins with an octave trill on A, then an arpeggiated A Minor chord. There is a sense of roaming as the music navigates through a series of broken chords, connected by scalar passages, before finally returning to the opening mood of A Minor. The solo instrument and sparse writing underscore its intimacy. The choice of piano in place of the original instrumentation of harpsichord (clavecin) should be noted, a nod to the instrument's importance in the film. Time seems to be suspended in the improvisatory hesitancy of the movement, forgoing any formal temporal structure in its absence of barlines. These qualities introduce our main character, Clarisse, in her lonely search for her family through multiple timelines.</p>

            <p>While the musical trajectory of the film is mostly chronological, becoming more modern and complicated in style as the plot progresses, Rameau acts as constant anchor point throughout the film. It is a marker, a musical reset leading into the next tonal shift in the film's soundtrack. It is Mussorgsky's Promenade in <i>Pictures at an Exhibition</i>, the "walking" in between movements representing individual paintings. The Rameau stands out as one of the few non-diegetic pieces of music in the soundtrack, emphasizing its atmospheric function.</p>

            <p>The first diegetic piece of music in Hold Me Tight establishes the importance of the progression in the classical piano repertoire of the film's soundtrack. Clarisse's early morning drive is accompanied by a cassette tape of her daughter Lucie's piano practice as she plays the distinct scalar passages of Hanon's exercises, the dreaded book of technical fundamentals for all young, beginner pianists. (Note that the first Hanon scale is in the key of C Major, the relative major key of the predominant A Minor key.) In an exclamation that any parent of musicians may resonate with, Clarisse wonders aloud when her daughter will play "real music". And finally, we hear Lucie play the two note motif that is instantly recognizable as Beethoven's Fur Elise. The playing is clearly juvenile, stumbling over notes and riddled with uneven rhythms, wrong notes, and repetitions. At this stage, the "etude" nature of the music is clear; Lucie is a beginner player, and the simplicity of the music reflects this.</p>

            <p>The film's first act ends as it began with Rameau. But this time, we hear his Gavotte et 6 Doubles, the final movement of the suite. Despite the roots of the gavotte as a lively peasant's dance, the primary theme of Rameau's gavotte is comparatively subdued. This quietude proves deceiving in the film's second act. As we follow a more mature Lucie, the soundtrack veers into later Romantic works and expands in scope beyond the solo piano to orchestral and choral works.</p>
