                A recent graduate of Yale University, where I read Economics and Mathematics, I have been employed as a teaching assistant in subjects ranging economics, statistics and data science, and computer science for undergraduate and graduate students. Throughout college, I have also offered private tutoring services to a limited number of high school students, mainly in essay writing and reading comprehension in preparation for college applications and the SATs.
